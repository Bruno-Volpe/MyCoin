## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine.

### Installation

To set up the project on your local machine and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

  Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

  After cloning, navigate to the project directory with:

  ```bash
  cd mycoin
  ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

  Next, install

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

  Finally, you can start the development server with:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

5. **Access the Application**

  The development server will likely run on `http://localhost:5173`. However, please check the terminal output after running the `npm run dev` command to be sure of the exact port.

### MetaMask Integration

In the top-right corner of the application, you'll find a button to connect with MetaMask. After establishing a connection, ensure you remain logged into the MetaMask app. If you log out, the application will automatically disconnect from MetaMask as a security measure.
